Paradigm-shift into paradox-based computation
through new forms of logic that use 6-valued logic.
The first two papers are inaccurate to my vision,
however they act as scaffolding or foundation to
understand the rest.  UO‚Å¥ and UO_2 are the major papers.
CTC is for computing time travel on a paradox-computer.
